I got another acceptance notification just after a few hours: the paper "A Taxonomy of System-Level Attacks on Deep Learning Models in Autonomous Vehicles
" has been accepted for publication in [TOSEM](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem). This is the second paper of mine with my PhD student, [Masoud Jamshidiyan Tehrani](https://search.usi.ch/en/people/eaac7118aec66918d71a30602cfc7ce5/jamshidiyantehrani-masoud).
